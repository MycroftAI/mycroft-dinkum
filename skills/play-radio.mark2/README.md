## About
Mycroft Radio plays internet radio stations from a free, 
user-curated index. It includes radio stations from all
over the world, in more than 100 languages. It includes hundreds
of genres of music as well as talk and news stations.

Mycroft Radio can play stations for any genre, such as 'pop' or 
'jazz'. Once playing, you can skip between stations within a genre (or "channel") 
or you can move between genres. Streaming can also be paused and
resumed.

Mycroft Radio can be configured to play stations in any language. 
By default it plays English stations, but this can be changed 
in the Radio skill settings on the Mycroft website.


## Examples

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems playing a station, try:

1) "Hey Mycroft, play radio". If this works, then you may be asking for a genre which isn't available 
or which Mycroft is having trouble interpreting correctly.
2) Say: "Hey Mycroft, show speech to text". This will show you how Mycroft 
interpreted your last few utterances. Certain genre names are difficult to get right.
