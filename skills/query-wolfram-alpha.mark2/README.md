Use Wolfram Alpha for general knowledge questions

## About
Ask general-knowledge queries of your Mycroft device.  If no other Skills can handle the _Intent_, [Wolfram Alpha](https://wolframalpha.com) will be queried
to see if it can find an answer.  You'll be surprised by how much it knows!

For deeper exploration, you can also request the sources behind the answer. An email will be sent to your registered account linking you to all the details within Wolfram Alpha's website.

## Examples
* "How tall is Mount Everest?"
* "When was The Rocky Horror Picture Show released?"
* "What is Madonna's real name?"
* "What's 18 times 4?"
* "How many inches in a meter?"
* "Send me the source on that"
