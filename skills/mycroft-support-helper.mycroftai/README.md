Capture information for Mycroft support

## About 
This Skill generates a package with debugging information and emails it to the email address registered in your [home.mycroft.ai](https://home.mycroft.ai) account. This package can be used for debugging issues yourself, or alternatively it can be emailed to Mycroft to create a support request. 

The package contains all of your `mycroft-core` logs on the Device, and information about active Skills and Intents at the time the support request was generated. 

This uses the [0x0.st](https://0x0.st/) service for storing the debugging information.

## Examples 
* "Create a support ticket"
* "You're not working!"
* "Send me debug info"
