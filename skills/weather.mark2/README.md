## About 
Get weather conditions, forecasts, expected precipitation and more!  By default, it will tell
you about your device's configured location. You can also ask for other cities around the world. 

Current conditions and weather forecasts come from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org).

The temperature is shown in Celsius or Fahrenheit depending on the preferences 
set in your [https://home.mycroft.ai](https://home.mycroft.ai) account.  You can ask 
specifically for a unit that differs from your configuration.
