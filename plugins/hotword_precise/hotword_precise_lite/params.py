    General pipeline information:
     - Audio goes through a series of transformations to convert raw audio into machine readable data
     - These transformations are as follows:
       - Raw audio -> chopped audio
         - buffer_t, sample_depth: Input audio loaded and truncated using these value
         - window_t, hop_t: Linear audio chopped into overlapping frames using a sliding window
       - Chopped audio -> FFT spectrogram
         - n_fft, sample_rate: Each audio frame is converted to n_fft frequency intensities
       - FFT spectrogram -> Mel spectrogram (compressed)
         - n_filt: Each fft frame is compressed to n_filt summarized mel frequency bins/bands
       - Mel spectrogram -> MFCC
         - n_mfcc: Each mel frame is converted to MFCCs and the first n_mfcc values are taken
       - Disabled by default: Last phase -> Delta vectors
         - use_delta: If this value is true, the difference between consecutive vectors is concatenated to each frame

    Parameters for audio pipeline:
     - buffer_t: Input size of audio. Wakeword must fit within this time
     - window_t: Time of the window used to calculate a single spectrogram frame
     - hop_t: Time the window advances forward to calculate the next spectrogram frame
     - sample_rate: Input audio sample rate
     - sample_depth: Bytes per input audio sample
     - n_fft: Size of FFT to generate from audio frame
     - n_filt: Number of filters to compress FFT to
     - n_mfcc: Number of MFCC coefficients to use
     - use_delta: If True, generates "delta vectors" before sending to network
     - vectorizer: The type of input fed into the network. Options listed in class Vectorizer
     - threshold_config: Output distribution configuration automatically generated from precise-calc-threshold
     - threshold_center: Output distribution center automatically generated from precise-calc-threshold
